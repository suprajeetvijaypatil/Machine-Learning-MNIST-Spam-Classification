## 📁 Projects Overview

### 1. Handwritten Digit Classification (Gaussian Naive Bayes)
* **Objective:** Developed a system to recognize handwritten digits (0-9) using the MNIST dataset. 
* **Methodology:** Implemented the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm, assuming pixel intensity features follow a normal distribution. 
* **Process:** Flattened 28x28 images into 784-feature vectors for probabilistic classification. 
* **Key Insight:** Served as a fundamental baseline for understanding how computers interpret visual patterns through statistical probabilities. 

### 2. Handwritten Digit Classification (Random Forest)
* **Objective:** Improved classification robustness on the MNIST dataset using ensemble learning. 
* **Methodology:** Implemented a Random Forest classifier to handle non-linear relationships between pixel values more effectively than single-tree models.
* **Performance:** Leveraged multiple decision trees to improve overall accuracy and reduce overfitting on high-dimensional image data. 


### 3. SMS Spam Detection (N-gram & Random Forest)
* **Objective:** Classify text messages as "Ham" (genuine) or "Spam" based on content patterns. 
* **Methodology:**
    * **Feature Extraction:** Utilized N-gram vectorization to capture word sequence context and frequency. 
    * **Classification:** Employed a Random Forest model to process the high-dimensional sparse data generated during the feature extraction phase. 
* **Result:** Successfully identified spam patterns by evaluating local extrema and tokenized word sequences.
